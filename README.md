# This is a repo for Bear Analyzer.
  You can go to -
      https://bearanalyzer.onrender.com
  and upload a photo. The analyzer will use Image Classification to predict which type of bear is in the photo or if it is a teddy. 

# This repo was created to test an Image Classifier.
This repo can be used as a starting point to deploy [fast.ai](https://github.com/fastai/fastai) models on Render.
The sample app described here is up at https://fastai-v3.onrender.com. Test it out with bear images!

This classifier has an added feature to detect polar bears too.
This is a simple neural net and has an accuracy of nearly 94%.

# Fasti repo was used for reference 
You can go to https://course.fast.ai/ and create a classifier of your own.
